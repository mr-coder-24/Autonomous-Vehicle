# Autonomous-Vehicle
This project aims to design and implement an autonomous vehicle with advanced braking and lane control systems. Using sensors and control algorithms, the vehicle autonomously navigates roads, detects obstacles, maintains safe distances, and ensures precise lane positioning. It also provides its live location continuously on a mobile application.
